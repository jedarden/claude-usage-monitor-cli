## Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

4. **IMPORTANT**: Choose "No" for "Initialize this repository with a README" (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add GitHub Remote and Push
After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/jedarden/claude-usage-cli.git

git push -u origin main
```

### 3. README Badges

### 4. Configure Repository Settings (Optional)
On GitHub, go to Settings and configure:

### 5. Create First Release (Optional)
